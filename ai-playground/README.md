# AI Playground Directory

This directory serves as a playground for AI development and experimentation with the Mini ELF Linker project.

## Purpose

This directory contains AI-generated test files, experimental scripts, and development iterations that were created during the development process. These files are preserved for reference and learning purposes but are not part of the core project structure.

## Contents

- **Test Scripts**: AI-generated Julia scripts for testing various linker functionality
- **Debug Files**: Development iterations and debugging scripts
- **Experimental Code**: Prototype implementations and proof-of-concept code
- **Test Binaries**: Generated executables and object files from experiments

## Usage

Feel free to use this directory for:
- AI-assisted development experiments
- Testing new features or approaches
- Debugging and analysis work  
- Learning from previous development iterations

## Important Note

**All files in this directory (except this README.md) are gitignored.** This means:
- You can create any files here without cluttering the git repository
- Experimental work won't accidentally be committed
- The directory serves as a safe space for AI development

## Original Project Structure

For the main project code, see:
- `src/` - Core implementation
- `test/` - Official test suite
- `examples/` - Example usage
- `specifications/` - Mathematical specifications
- `strategic_analysis/` - Production planning
- `verification/` - Testing methodology

This playground complements the mathematical-driven AI development methodology described in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.
